## Asking Questions
Have a question? Rather than opening an issue, please ask away on [Stack Overflow](https://stackoverflow.com/).

### Look For an Existing Issue

Before you create a new issue, please do a search in [open issues](https://github.com/jitblox/issues/issues) to see if the issue or feature request has already been filed.

If you find your issue already exists, make relevant comments and add your [reaction](https://github.com/blog/2119-add-reactions-to-pull-requests-issues-and-comments). Use a reaction in place of a "+1" comment:

* üëç - upvote
* üëé - downvote

If you cannot find an existing issue that describes your bug or feature, create a new issue using the guidelines below.

### Writing Good Bug Reports and Feature Requests

File a single issue per problem and feature request. Do not enumerate multiple bugs or feature requests in the same issue.

Do not add your issue as a comment to an existing issue unless it's for the identical input. Many issues look similar, but have different causes.

The more information you can provide, the more likely we will be successful at reproducing the issue and finding a fix.

Please include the following with each issue:

* Your operating system

* Your browser and browser version

* Reproducible steps (1... 2... 3...) that cause the issue

* What you expected to see, versus what you actually saw

* Images, animations, or a link to a video showing the issue occurring

* If you encountered the issue on a project that is public, include the URL of your project
